# Comparative Graph Analysis: Group 1 vs Control Group

## Graph 1: Distribution of Percentage Changes — Group 1 vs Control Group
- **What it shows:**  
  - Histogram comparing percentage change distributions between **Group 1 (blue)** and **Control Group (orange)**.  
  - Kernel density estimate (KDE) lines plotted for smoother visualization.  

- **Key Observations:**  
  - Control Group has extremely large values (up to **7M**), creating a long orange tail.  
  - Group 1 distribution is tighter and clustered on the left, suggesting moderate changes.  
  - Orange histogram bar labeled **"169"** shows the mode (most frequent value) for the Control group.  
  - Skewed values in the Control Group make comparisons on the same scale difficult.  

- **Implications:**  
  - Control Group contains extreme outliers, suggesting rare but massive percentage changes.  
  - Group 1’s changes are more stable and contained, potentially signaling better predictability.

# General Implications

## 1. Volatility vs Stability
- **Group 1:** High volatility with large fluctuations → riskier strategies, larger potential gains/losses.  
- **Control Group:** More stable and conservative → fewer risks, smaller changes.  
- **Note:** Extreme outliers in the Control Group show occasional erratic performance.  

## 2. Performance Evaluation
- Control Group’s outliers skew perceptions → most equity changes are minimal, but rare large changes dominate.  
- Group 1’s tighter distributions make performance **more predictable**, useful for reliability assessments.  

## 3. Growth Trends
- **Group 1:** Declining averages suggest strategic or market challenges over time.  
- **Control Group:** Late sharp increase signals **adaptive recovery and growth**.  

## 4. Asset Management
- **Group 1:** Massive rise in fixed assets = aggressive expansion, but highly volatile.  
- **Both Groups:** More modest changes in current assets and payables → controlled management.
